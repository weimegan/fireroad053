Provides practical insight, from regional to global scale, with applications to past and future climates. Emphasizes salient features of the mean climate system and modes of natural variability, as well as observed and projected manifestations of anthropogenic climate change. Students gain experience accessing, analyzing, and visualizing a wide range of gridded observational-based datasets, as well as output from global climate model simulations. Develops the tools necessary to apply climate diagnostic analysis to one's own research, as well as the interdisciplinary edge to critically assess and interpret the observational and model results underpinning the Fifth Assessment Reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.",

Considers why countries and regions trade, and what goods they trade; impediments to trade, and why some countries deliberately erect policy to impede; and implications of openness for growth. Also tackles normative issues, such as whether trade openness is beneficial, whether there are winners and losers from trade and, if so, how they can possibly be identified.",

Provides an overview of contemporary urban issues, situates them in relation to a genealogy of urban precedents, and constructs a theoretical framework that engages the allied fields of architecture, landscape architecture, political ecology, geography, territorial planning, and environmental humanities. Comprised of three sections, first section articulates a framework on the urban as both process and form, shifting the emphasis from city to territory. Second section engages a series of related urban debates, such as density/sprawl, growth/shrinkage, and codes/exception. Third section calls upon urban agency in the age of environment through the object of infrastructures of trash, water, oil, and food. Limited to 25.",

Covers foundations and recent advances of machine learning in the framework of statistical learning theory. Focuses on regularization techniques key to high-dimensional supervised learning. Starting from classical methods such as regularization networks and support vector machines, addresses state-of-the-art techniques based on principles such as geometry or sparsity, and discusses a variety of algorithms for supervised learning, feature selection, structured prediction, and multitask learning. Also focuses on unsupervised learning of data representations, with an emphasis on hierarchical (deep) architectures.",

            "description": "This exploratory seminar offers students a deeper mathematical introduction to classical mechanics than they receive in the standard CC.801 subject. The extra material shares some topics with the mainstream subject 8.012, but here pursued in an exploratory context. In addition, toward the end of the semester, students will be introduced to the basic principles of special and general relativity. Meets twice weekly to discuss physics concepts that go beyond the 8.01 lectures as well as to work on more advanced kinds of problems. This seminar hopes to further engage students already interested in majoring in physics, as well as those who wish simply to explore what physics has to offer. Licensed for academic year 2019-2020 by the Committee on Curricula. Subject can count toward the 9-unit discovery-focused credit limit for first year-students. Limited to students enrolled in Concourse.",

After the initial meetings, students are encouraged to take more responsibility and to lead the group in problem-solving sessions. Each study group meets for a minimum of three hours each week.

Should doctors be allowed to help patients end their lives? If so, when and how? Should embryos be cloned for research and/or reproduction? Should parents be given control over the genetic make-up of their children? What types of living things are appropriate to use as research subjects? How should we distribute scarce and expensive medical resources? Draws on philosophy, history, and anthropology to show how problems in bioethics can be approached from a variety of perspectives.",

            "description": "Investigates theories and practices of feminist inquiry across a range of disciplines. Feminist research involves rethinking disciplinary assumptions and methodologies, developing new understandings of what counts as knowledge, seeking alternative ways of understanding the origins of problems/issues, formulating new ways of asking questions and redefining the relationship between subjects and objects of study. Focus on methodology, i.e., the theory and analysis of how research should proceed. Special attention to epistemological issues--pre-suppositions about the nature of knowledge. What makes research distinctively feminist lies in the complex connections between epistemologies, methodologies and research methods. Explore how these connections are formed in the traditional disciplines and raise questions about why they are inadequate and/or problematic for feminist inquiry and what, specifically, are the feminist critiques of these intersections.",
